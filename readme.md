#Arduino & 888 Victor Library

## TODO

* Make arduino library system compatible with Git Submodules
* Make using analog inputs easier, have a method/constructor for that
* Attach CheckQueue method to end of loop() (unsure if possible)
* More methods for getting/setting
* Constructor to pass just one Victor instead of Array of Victors
